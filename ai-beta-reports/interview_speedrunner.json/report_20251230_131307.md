**Commentary:**
> "I couldn't even begin testing the application. The moment I tried to access http://localhost:3010/interview, I hit a hard wall - ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED. The server isn't running.

As a Speedrunner who has no patience for friction, this is the worst possible start. I expect applications to be ready when I need them. There's no faster way to lose a power user than to waste their time with setup issues.

**What went wrong:**
- The application wasn't accessible at the provided URL
- No clear indication of whether I needed to start a server first
- Zero ability to evaluate the actual user experience, interface, or functionality

**Impact on trust:**
This completely destroys trust. If I can't even load the first screen, how can I trust anything else about the product? For a real-world scenario, this would be equivalent to a user clicking a link and getting nothing - instant abandonment.

**Cognitive load:**
Massively increased. Instead of jumping into the app and getting things done, I'm stuck troubleshooting infrastructure issues. This is the opposite of what a Speedrunner wants.

**Bottom line:**
Cannot provide a meaningful UX assessment without a working application. The one finding I could report: critical blocker preventing any user access. Would not attempt to use again until basic availability is confirmed."
